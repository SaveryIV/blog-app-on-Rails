<!-- FUTURE FEATURES -->

## 🔭 Future Features <a name="future-features"></a>

- **Artificial intelligence (AI) powered features:** AI could be used to help users automatically identify and catalog items, as well as to provide recommendations for new items to add to their collection.

- **Integration with smart home devices:** The Catalog of My Things could be integrated with smart home devices, such as smart speakers and displays, to allow users to control their catalog using voice commands.

- **Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) features:** AR and VR could be used to create a more immersive experience for users, allowing them to view their catalog items in 3D or to even "walk through" their collection.

- **Social media integration:** Users could be able to share their catalogs with others on social media, or to see what other people are collecting.
Marketplace integration: Users could be able to buy and sell items from their catalogs through a marketplace integration.

These are just a few ideas for future features that could be added to the Catalog of My Things project. The specific features that are added will depend on the needs and wants of the users.
